# Imbalanced-Data

Assignment for Artificial Intelligence and Society, 1st Year, 1st Semester, Master Degree in Artificial Intelligence.

# Summary

The aim of this work is to explore the impact of class imbalance on machine learning tasks and how this can reflect a possible source of bias in models. By comparing various resampling techniques, such as undersampling, oversampling and hybrid techniques, the aim is to analyze how these approaches influence the performance of models, especially in identifying the minority class. The work aims to provide a reflection on the implications of these techniques for building reliable and effective machine learning applications.
